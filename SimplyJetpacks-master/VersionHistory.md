1.5.3 - 2015-11-19
----------------------------------
- FIXED: Errors / log spam during startup when using newer versions of Forge



1.5.2 - 2015-11-02
----------------------------------
- ADDED: Config option to disable Redstone Arsenal items being registered if that mod is not installed. This disables the Flux-Infused JetPlate.
- CHANGED: Updated the texture of the Flux-Infused JetPlate with the Enderium Flux Overlay installed to match Redstone Armory's newer textures.
- CHANGED: Renamed Enriched Soularium Alloy to Dark Soularium Ingot. Now also registered in the Ore Dictionary as `ingotDarkSoularium`
- FIXED: Pack GUI key not showing in jetpack/flux pack tooltips if the control is bound to a mouse button
- FIXED: Config files being (over)written on disk every time the game starts; now only done when their contents are actually changed.


1.5.1 - 2015-05-23
----------------------------------
- FIXED: Crash when trying to craft jetpacks if Redstone Armory is not installed

1.5.0 - 2015-05-22
----------------------------------
- CHANGED: **Now depends on CoFHLib.** Using either CoFH Core 3.0.2+ or CoFHLib standalone 1.0.2+ works for this.
- ADDED: Support for BuildCraft 6! SJ now provides two kinds of BuildCraft-based jetpacks, based on which BC modules are installed. One is powered by Fuel, and one is powered by RF. Will hopefully also work with BuildCraft 7, though this is largely untested.
- ADDED: Jetpack Fueller item for filling fluid-based jetpacks with fluids from Tanks or similar.
- ADDED: GUI for worn jetpacks and flux packs, opened by pressing a key (U by default). It shows their current fuel levels, and lets you turn various features on and off.
- ADDED: Fuel Efficiency enchantment. This somewhat rare enchantment decreases the amount of fuel used by jetpacks and flux packs when flying or being damaged.
- ADDED: Enderium Flux Overlay to make a Flux-Infused JetPlate look like an Enderium Flux armor piece. Available when Redstone Armory is installed.
- ADDED: Config option to make jetpacks explode and kill their user when flying through flammable fluids. Blame Vexatos for this idea. Disabled by default.
- ADDED: Readded the option to disable 3D armor models. This is for people that experience issues with the armor models and mods like Smart Moving.
- CHANGED: Recipes for TE-based thrusters to be less annoying and to... make more sense, I guess.
- CHANGED: Only one kind of mod integration is now enabled by default: always TE if it is present, or always EIO if TE is not present, or lastly BC if neither of the previous are present.
- CHANGED: Split 'secondary' (sneak-activated) keybinds into keybinds of their own. Not bound by default in favour of the new GUI.
- CHANGED: Using a jetpack underwater is now a bit slower, and makes it produce bubbles.
- CHANGED: It is now possible to enable sprinting in the air while wearing a jetpack by double-tapping the forward key. This can be disabled in the client config if it gets annoying.
- FIXED: Not being able to turn off only part of the HUD

1.4.1 - 2015-02-20
----------------------------------
- Fixed crash on dedicated server startup

1.4.0 - 2015-02-20
----------------------------------
- Added jetpack sounds. Many thanks to nabijaczleweli for their help with this one. The volume for these sounds can be set with the volume slider for the 'Players' sound category. They can also be disabled as a whole in the config (clientside).
- Refactored code to be cleaner, less redundant and more flexible.
- All jetpack/flux pack types can now be tuned individually (instead of being bound to a list of tiers).
- The Flux-Infused JetPlate is now craftable even if Redstone Arsenal is not installed.
- Localized keybind names. The mod's keybinds will likely be reset when updating to this version.
- Jetpack particles now spread out a little bit instead of going straight down.
- Creative Jetpacks now have rainbow smoke particles by default.
- Added a small limit on how quickly jetpacks can be charged by external sources. (Configurable)
- Removed 'flat' jetpack armor models.
- Texture pack authors, you'll have to rename some texture files: tuberous/creative/icon jetpacks, creative flux packs, and 3d jetpack armor models.


1.3.2 - 2014-12-27
----------------------------------
- Armor is now properly configurable by reduction amounts
- Fixed major bug in armor that could negate armor values
- Fixed energy HUD scale affecting other mod HUDs


1.3.1 - 2014-12-16
----------------------------------
- Updated Capacitor Pack recipes for the new version of Ender IO


1.3.0 - 2014-12-06
----------------------------------
- Added 3D armor models for the jetpacks. Many thanks to Cybercat and dand0 for providing a model. (There is a config option to switch back to the boring old flat jetpacks.)
- Added a configurable speed boost when sprinting while flying forward
- Adding or removing armor is now done using a crafting grid. This allows armored jetpacks to be auto-crafted. Note that removing armor will only properly return plating if done by a player.
- Removed armoring NEI handlers as they are no longer needed
- Emergency hover mode can be toggled by switching hover mode while sneaking
- Added /simplyjetpacks_switch (/sjs) command to switch emergency hover and chargers, and a config option to disable secondary actions when sneaking and pressing the toggling keys
- Sneaking while flying slows down sideways flight to half speed
- Jetpacks and Flux Packs are now on by default upon creation
- Sneak-right clicking a jetpack on a Zombie or a Skeleton will force it to wear and use it
- Fixed armored jetpacks absorbing much more damage than intended. This was making players invincible when they were also wearing other pieces of armor
- Fixed engine/hover controls not working when bound to mouse buttons
- Updated CoFH Energy API, and actually include the whole package this time *cough*
- RIP, resource pack authors


1.2.0 - 2014-10-18
----------------------------------
- Added full EnderIO support! This includes EnderIO versions of the jetpacks, flux packs and components.
- Integration with TE or EIO can be disabled/enabled in the config
- Changed the structure of the config... again. Mainly the tuning portions of it, make sure to transfer over any edits you did to them if needed.
- HUD now hides if F3 debug mode is enabled
- Code refactors and cleanups
- Note: the item IDs of Creative Jetpack/Flux Packs, Tuberous Jetpacks and Armor Platings have changed. Shouldn't cause any problems, they will just disappear or change into missing textures which you can just delete.


1.1.4 - 2014-10-02
----------------------------------
- Removed potentially infinite loop when upgrading jetpacks
- Fixed Leadstone Jetpack recipe not taking power from used Leadstone Flux Capacitors
- Recipes that use glass blocks now use Ore Dictionary glass

----------------------------------
- Fixed spamming isue in the client console


1.1.1 - 2014-09-14
----------------------------------

- Enchantability can now be set per jetpack/flux pack
- Jetpack particles now respect the particles option in the video settings menu
- Split the config file so that the client-only options are kept separate
- Fly and descend keys can now be changed using the configs, to be something else than the vanilla jump and sneak keys.
- Fixed potential memory leak in single player

1.1.0 - 2014-08-16
----------------------------------
- Added Flux Packs. These items are worn as chestplates and can charge held items and other worn armor.
- Added the Flux-Infused JetPlate. Only available when Redstone Arsenal is installed, this is the new final tier of jetpacks. It is basically the Flux-Infused Chestplate, the Resonant Jetpack and the Resonant Flux Pack in one.
- Hover mode no longer makes the jetpack use less power. Default tuning values have been adjusted to balance this out.
- Some rebalancing of the default tuning values. If you wish to use these, use the config GUI to reset the tuning values, or delete the config file.
- Added a NEI plugin to show the 'recipes' for armored jetpacks.
- Replaced the status chat messages with a new part in the HUD that displays the states of the jetpack engine, hover mode, etc. Chat messages can still be enabled in the config.
- Updated CoFH API

- Fixed a bug in jetpack upgrading recipes


1.0.0 - 2014-07-30

- LOTS of changes in the format of the language files. It is likely that anything other than English will break. If you want to fix this, please open a pull request.
- Also a lot of changes to what the texture file names are called. Sorry, texture pack users!
