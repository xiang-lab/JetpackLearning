This is a sample repo to show how to use the Android Jetpack announced in the Google I/O 2018 for android254 Meetup, at iHub Nairobi. :rocket:

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* DataBinding -  minimize the glue code necessary to bind your application logic and layouts.
* Java 8 support - added lambda support

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to run this project:
1. A laptop or desktop machine with internet access
2. Android Studio 3.1.2 Stable Channel (Latest Stable Release)
